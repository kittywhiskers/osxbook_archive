OTA: Episode VI : Return of the (je)Diff
========================================

### Provide a simple but useful diff between OTA contents at file name or file content level

### About

Trying to look for how Apple patched that nasty unicode character bug in 11.2.6 made me realize that, like the [search functionality I put into my OTA tool](http://newosxbook.com/articles/OTA5.html), a diff feature would also be cool. So I did.

This feature works remarkably well between micro-updates (i.e. X.y.z to X.y.(z+n), e.g. 11.2.5-> 11.2.6, and between OTAs of the same model:

```

# Assume at this point 'p' is the extracted pbzx.
# If you don't know what I'm talking about, start at chapter 1 of the series.

But wait, you say! What about updates from X.y to X.w? Or maybe from X... to V...? Doing a file comparison would yield so many changes you'll miss the signal for the noise, right? Well, for that I introduce the "-n", which will only check for name differences:

```
root@Qilin (/NewOSXBook/..../iPhone10,6/11.2.6) # ota -n -d ./p ../11.1.1/p | head -5
Applications/AXUIViewService.app: In file1 but not file2
Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService: In file1 but not file2
Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService-Entitlements.plist: In file1 but not file2
Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService.strings: In file1 but not file2
Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService.stringsdict: In file1 but not file2
root@Qilin (/NewOSXBook/..../iPhone10,6/11.2.6) # ota -l p | grep Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService-Entitlements.plist
Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService-Entitlements.plist
root@Qilin (/NewOSXBook/..../iPhone10,6/11.2.6) # ota -l ../11.1.1/p | grep Applications/AXUIViewService.app/AXUIViewService-Entitlements.plist
```

Note that I'm super lazy here, so I only diff file 1 vs. file 2. You probably want to run the older OTA image as "file2" for this reason, although you can always switch them around, of course

### License

*   All yours. A nice greet would be nice if you end up github'ing it like some people do. Plagiarism is low.

### P.S.

*   Yes, I cover the (very basic) file format in the upcoming MOXiI 2nd Ed (Volume II, though, so you'll have to wait a bit).
*   And I also talk about this stuff in [The Tg Training](http://technologeeks.com/OSXRE) - the next one in April 30th right in the heart of Manhattan :)
