OTA: Episode V : XZ strikes back
================================

### Integrates xz into pbzx, and supports those uncompressed blocks you find here and there

### About

The new HomePod (AudioAccessory1,1) OTA which Apple released (for whatever reason) is slightly incompatible with my old pbzx implementation due to quite a few uncompressed (16M) blocks they have in the middle of the XZ stream. I normally handled this with a shell script, but figured I can just integrate xz-devel's lzma decompressor directly. So here it is. You won't need to run `xz` manually anymore (though you will need liblzma, which you can easily get). This has been tested on all OTA updates (iOS/WatchOS/TvOS/PodOS/MacOS), but **if something doesn't work for you, TELL ME**.

Because lzma's not my source, I added my mods there with an `#ifndef NOJ`.

This works on MacOS and Linux. Sources will compile if you have liblzma ([https://tukaani.org/xz/](https://tukaani.org/xz/), or the Linux xz-devel package).

### Example

```
root@Qilin (/NewOSXBook/.../payloadv2)  cat payload |./pbzx > OTA               12:46
Flags: 0x1000000
Chunk #1 (flags: 1000000, length: 3343604 bytes)
OK!  (16777216 bytes)

Chunk #246 (flags: 1000000, length: 3748084 bytes)
OK!  (16777216 bytes)
Chunk #247 (flags: 461405, length: 1190692 bytes)
OK!  (4587520 bytes)
...
\# Warnings are totally fine - these are the uncompressed chunks
Chunk #95 (flags: 1000000, length: 16777216 bytes)
Warning: Can't find XZ header. Instead have 0xc83bbeb5(?).. This is likely not XZ data.
Chunk #96 (flags: 1000000, length: 16777216 bytes)
..
Chunk #246 (flags: 1000000, length: 3748084 bytes)
OK!  (16777216 bytes)
Chunk #247 (flags: 461405, length: 1190692 bytes)
OK!  (4587520 bytes)

\# You can check integrity of the OTA by -l and ignoring output:
# If there are any issues, they'll be reported to stderr (2>)
root@Qilin (/NewOSXBook/.../payloadv2) # ota -l OTA > /dev/null                  12:48

### License

*   All yours. A nice greet would be nice if you end up github'ing it like some people do.

### Greets

*   **AAPL:** For just giving up on encryption and providing non-differential OTAs for devices whose filesystem would be almost impossible to obtain otherwise
*   **https://tukaani.org/xz/** - for making XZ freeware

### P.S.

*   Yes, I cover the (very basic) file format in the upcoming MOXiI 2nd Ed (Volume II, though)
*   Yes, Volume I is on track for its scheduled release , as per [The official announcement](http://newosxbook.com/2ndUpdate.html).
