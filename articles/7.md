OTA: Episode VII : The OTA awakens
==================================

### Two simple enhancements: -v and -S, to make searching really effective

### About

Using the search functionality more than ever on iOS 12 and HomePod OTAs (for which there are no IPSWs) made me realize I can extend search functionality greatly with a few more lines of code:

*   Use `-v` with `-s` to also output the matching string. Useful when you get some partial match of a larger string and you have no idea what it is, and you then have to extract the file, only to realize, fud, it's not what you were looking for. `-v` will print up to -/+20 characters before/after the match, and highlight the match for you. You can change the 20 magic value by recompiling.
*   Use `-S` to match the string as a suffix (in other words, ensure a NULL byte immediately after it). This dramatically reduces false positives if you are looking for a Mach service name, entitlement, etc

### License

*   All yours. A nice greet would be nice if you end up github'ing it like some people do. Plagiarism is low.

### P.S.

*   Yes, I cover the (very basic) file format in the upcoming MOXiI 2nd Ed (Volume II, though, so you'll have to wait a bit).
*   And I also talk about this stuff in [The Tg Training](http://Technologeeks.com/OSXRE) - the next one in April 30th right in the heart of Manhattan :)
