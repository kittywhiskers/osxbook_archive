OTA revisited - a quick followup
================================

### A simple script to recreate the iOS filesystem on your Mac

### About

iOS ~9~ 9.2 is out , and we are once more in an unbreakable window. This is very likely temporary, but AAPL has put some seriously remarkable efforts into getting things right this time. Vectors in the good ol' DYLD are all but gone, and the new "System Integrity Protection" (a.k.a "rootless") is a royal pain (though still bypassable).

Researchers trying to find faults in the system - by analyzing its binaries - can easily get the full image thanks to [@Xerub's](http://twitter.com/xerub) keys for the iPhone 5. This, however, only covers 32-bit. For 64-bit, there are no publicly available decryption keys. Fortunately, the OTA vector [described in detail by yours truly in a previous article](http://newosxbook.com/articles/OTA.html) still works. Said article also contains a small tool - aptly named ota - to extract the payload files, once de-pbzx'ed and `xz -d`'ed. It also refers to the use of `bxpatch` for files. Fellow iPhoneWiki user npupyshev has a working sample of bxpatch in this [this GitHub](https://github.com/npupyshev/bxdiff), which you can use. For those lazy to compile, I put it in the download.

Because I'm actively reversing iOS 9 for [MOXiI 2](http://newosxbook.com/TOC2.html), I wrote a small script to enable me to use an OTA zip (which you can get easily through [the iPhone Wiki](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/OTA_Updates/iPhone) along with the base filesystem on a jailbroken device - in my case ~8.4~ 9.0.2 on an iPhone ~7,2~ 8,2 - to reconstruct the filesystem on the host. I'm attaching it here.


**Dec 12 2015: Update: Just tested this on the 9.2 OTA (from 9.0.2). Works :-)**  
**Feb 04 2016: Can use this with the jumbo OTA updates as well (9.3b3 works)**  
**Feb 16 2016: Wait, there's more - [Part Three](http://newosxbook.com/articles/OTA3.html)**  

This is not some zero day, or really anything new - it's just applying [the previous article](http://newosxbook.com/articles/OTA.html) and putting in a little recursive shell script - but it's useful. So that's why I'm putting it here. I would like to share the binaries themselves from iOS 9, but I can't do that lest I want AAPL breathing down my neck - and this method is fully reproducible, so it makes for a nice Do-It-Yourself experiment

### Usage:

Say you grabbed an update zip from AAPL - put it in some directory, and unzip it

```
Zephyr:OTA morpheus$ unzip 076577b6c8473847597916af4888f5508efaa861.zip
Archive:  076577b6c8473847597916af4888f5508efaa861.zip

  inflating: AssetData/post.bom      
  inflating: AssetData/pre.bom       
  inflating: Info.plist   
```

Next, unpack the tar file from [this link](http://newosxbook.com/files/OTApack.tar), and you will see:

```
Zepyhr:/tmp morpheus$ mkdir New; cd New
Zepyhr:/tmp/New morpheus$ tar xvf OTApack.tar
x applyota.sh
x bxpatch
x liblzma.dylib   \# Just in case you don't have it
x ota.c  \# The source for ota, in case you want that too
x otaa

It is assumed at this point that you have **A connected iOS device with the base image to which the OTA update applies. You can connect it over usbmuxd, or over WiFi - that's irrelevant, so as long as you change the lines in the script which need changing, namely:**

DEFIOSDEV=root@phontifex-2 \# likely root@localhost for you
DEFIOSPORT=2222  \# Leave 2222 if via USBMux

UNPACKED\_OTA\_DIR=~/Downloads/OTA \# Point at where OTA was unzipped

Do yourself a favor and add your ssh key to /var/root/.ssh/authorized\_keys. This not only is more secure than root:alpine, but also saves you endless prompts when accessing your device, which this script does to retrieve the files

At any rate, you can then run the small `applyota.sh` script, like so:

Zephyr:New morpheus$ ./applyota.sh sbin/launchd
Retrieving launchd from your device...
launchd                                                                 100%  267KB 266.9KB/s   00:00    
Patching sbin/launchd with patch from /Users/morpheus/Downloads/OTA/AssetData/payloadv2/patches/sbin/launchd
Zephyr:New morpheus$ ls -l sbin/launchd
-rw-r--r--  1 morpheus  staff  290368 Sep 24 09:05 sbin/launchd
\# Verify with jtool - if --sig doesn't complain, the signature is intact
Zephyr:New morpheus$ jtool --sig !$
jtool --sig sbin/launchd
Blob at offset: 288432 (1936 bytes) is an embedded signature

Entitlements (258 bytes) (use --ent to view)

```

And this also works recursively (which is why I made the script in the first place!)

### Q&A

*   **Where are all the rest of the files?**

    This script handles only patches. Those files which are in full are in the payload.00\[0-8\] files. Following the last article to the letter with the attached ota tool will get you all of the files. This will look something like:
```
    # You dont have to do this as root.. I just was at the time
    bash-3.2# pwd
    /Users/morpheus/Downloads/OTA/AssetData/payloadv2
    bash-3.2# ls
    links.txt		payload.001		payload.004		payload.007		prepare\_patches
    patches			payload.002		payload.005		payload.008		prepare\_payload
    payload.000		payload.003		payload.006		payload\_chunks.txt	removed.txt
    bash-3.2# for p in in payload.\* ; do ~/bin/pbzx  $p > extracted.$p.xz; done
    ..
    bash-3.2# file extracted.\*
    extracted.payload.000.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.001.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.002.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.003.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.004.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.005.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.006.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.007.xz: xz compressed data
    extracted.payload.008.xz: xz compressed data
    bash-3.2# for i in extracted.\*; do xz -d $i; done
    \# Then apply the ota tool (-e '\*' to extract, or just -l to list)
    bash-3.2#  for i in extracted.\*; do ~/bin/otaa -l $i; done

    Applications/AACredentialRecoveryDialog.app/\_CodeSignature/CodeResources
    Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/Info.plist
    Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/\_CodeSignature/CodeResources
    ...
    \# To look for a file in the extracted payload
    bash-3.2#  for i in extracted.\*; do ~/bin/otaa -l $i; done | grep sbin
    usr/sbin/WirelessRadioManagerd
    usr/sbin/absd
    usr/sbin/fairplayd.H2
    usr/sbin/spindump
    \# Then extract
    bash-3.2# for i in extracted.\*; do ~/bin/otaa -e usr/sbin/absd $i ; done
    bash-3.2# ls -l usr/sbin/absd
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  583552 Sep 24 19:59 usr/sbin/absd
```
*   **What about the shared library cache?**

    Good question. I haven't figured out the .dydiff format yet, but apparently I don't need to - connect an iOS 9 device to XCode, and it will suck all the libraries + full symbols automatically, and shove them in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode somewhere. Why? I don't know. Yet another case of AAPL shutting doors and opening windows.

*   **I'm getting weird errors/jtool complains/etc** - You're probably using an incorrect OTA zip for your iOS device. **Make sure the iPhone/iPod/iPad model number is right**. I tested this on my iPhone 6 (7,2), and it worked splendidly well.
*   **I want this for Linux!** - Well this is a shell script, so it should work - if you compile the binaries for ELF.. ota.c is ANSI C, and should compile neatly for Linux. npupyshev's code will likely also compile for Linux, though I can't say I've tried. The script flow would be exactly the same
*   **Where do I say thanks/complain/bitch/comment/flame?** [Right here](http://newosxbook.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=16602).
